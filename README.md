# decathlon_survey_back
Decathlon Survey project's back end (PHP)

This project was realised during an internship at Solutec.

The main objective was to build a web & mobile platform used by Decathlon's employees to create surveys and gather results.

This repository contains the back-end part of the web application, built in PHP using Symfony and communicating with the front-end through a GraphQL API.
